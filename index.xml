      <description>Intro You will be able to see here all meaningful words appearing commonly in JAlgoArena domain. By domain we understand vocabulary used to describe business logic.
In case anything important is missing in here, please create a new issue.
Domain  Term Description   Submission The basic domain entity within JAlgoArena. It holds all necessery information for every user problem solution together with results after judgement.

      <description>Deploy with Docker &amp; Nomad To deploy JAlgoArena - you will need to spin up Nomad and Consul clusters plus install Docker Engine.
 Make sure Docker is available on your machines Install Consul and Nomad clusters  use step0.sh to run locally on your laptop - it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended for production use case Install Consul Cluster Install Nomad Cluster  Once you have Nomad and Consul up and running, you may start running JAlgoArena external services:  Clone JAlgoArena-Nomad locally git clone https://github.</description>

      <description>Key factor to JAlgoArena development – ubiquitous automation Nowadays we software engineers are in common agreement - automation is key to success an DevOps movement just proves that. The goal of developing JAlgoArena from the very beginning was to make as much of automated deployment as possible - and in this post I want to explain how does it look like.
Deployment flow  Initially, developer push his changes to GitHub In next stage, GitHub notifies Travis CI about changes Travis CI runs whole continuous integration flow, running compilation, tests and generating reports  coverage report is sent to Codecov using Gradle script builds and publishes new docker image for new tags (releases) zip package is saved to GitHub releases for new tags (releases)  Nomad jobs takes artifact and deploy/scale automatically JAlgoArena components  docker images for docker based environment zip packages for non-docker based environment   Continuous Delivery diagram Possible improvements For now there is still couple of manual steps, some of them are such by design, others where yet not replaced:</description>

      <description>Intro JAlgoArena conducts many parts, which can be divided to:
 Node.JS hosted Web UI Traefik as Edge Service Nomad as scheduler Consul for Service Discovery Apache Kafka used for messaging internally in the backend Elastic Stack for capturing distributed logs Cockroach DB for highly available data storage JAlgoArena microservices delivering core features  Diagram  Publish submission to Kafka. Save new submission (JAlgoArena-Submissions) &amp;amp; start judge process (JAlgoArena-Judge)  Request submissions refresh via WebSocket subscriptions (JAlgoArena-Submissions)  Publish submission result Store submission and ranking result (the second only if submission is accepted) Request ranking &amp;amp; submissions refresh via WebSocket subscriptions  Components JAlgoArena microservices:</description>

      <description>Problem Difficulty Firstly, base amount of points depends on problem difficulty:
 Difficulty Base Points   Easy 10 points   Medium 30 points   Hard 50 points   Time Penalty Secondly, amount of points which depends on time penalty:
 Elapsed Time / Time Limit Points Factor   &amp;gt;= 500 1.0   &amp;gt;= 100 3.0   &amp;gt;= 10 5.0   &amp;gt;= 1 8.</description>
