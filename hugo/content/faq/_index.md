## JAlgoArena looks awesome. Who is it for?

We designed JAlgoArena as self-hosted platform to run algorithmic contest for the developers and other people involved into software engineering. If your teams loves hackathons, that may be another alternative for them to enjoy some coding time and competition - but fairly focused on algorithmic contest. JAlgoArena is a platform, which helps to put operational efforts to run such competition to a minimum. Although it supports now mainly **Java** - in future more languages will come. It makes JAlgoArena ideal for running challenging competition across your teams, build a team spirit and healthy competition!

## Isn’t it a great idea to add some awesome features to JAlgoArena?

Yes and nope in the same time. We want to keep JAlgoArena minimalistic, but still there is plenty of valuable features to come. All in all - if you have proposal for some new story - please use [JAlgoArena issues](https://github.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena/issues) to raise a new requests.

## What Does the Future Hold for JAlgoArena? What’s the plan?

Right now, JAlgoArena is a self-sufficient, modern and complete product. Although there are two directions of growth - operational and features based.

Having this said, if you are interested to see details on what's planned - take a look on [JAlgoArena kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/jalgoarena/projects/1).

## How do I migrate from an older version to the latest one?

Depending on microservice you want to upload - if there is just patch version change just replace existing version with a new one using deployment mode of your choice.

## Can I create new programming languages providers for JAlgoArena?

You absolutely can! You may refer to docs for what kind of API is required to be exposed by Judge Agent in terms of supporting existing architecture.
