<h3 class="section-head" id="h-ranking"><a href="#h-ranking">Ranking</a></h3>

There are three different types of rankings which you can read about on [domain page](https://jalgoarena.github.io/docs/domain/#h-domain), let's see below examples.

Additionally, it's worth to know:

* `Submission ID` - the ID generated by UI which you have seen after running your submissions on __problem__ page
* `Run At` - registered time by JAlgoArena queue of your submission
* `Source Code` - after clicking you will see modal window with your submission source code
* `Problem ID` - button to take you to specified __problem__ page

Of course that's good to have, but more interesting would be to see submission results!

In here again there are few columns, let's explain them:

* `ID` - indicating persisted entity id of your submission
* `Elapsed Time (ms)` - time your submission took to solve all given test cases in milliseconds
* `Status` - status of your submission, to see more detail and explanation check [domain page](https://jalgoarena.github.io/docs/domain/#h-domain)
* `Test Cases` - labels showing how many test cases passed, and how many failed
* `Source Code` - after clicking you will see modal window with your submission source code
* `Error Message` - after clicking you will see modal window with error message during run of your submission (disabled if no error)
* `Problem ID` - button to take you to specified __problem__ page

You can always check source code of your submissions:

And error message:
