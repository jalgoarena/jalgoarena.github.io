<h3 class="section-head" id="h-basic-template"><a href="#h-basic-template">Deploy with Docker & Nomad</a></h3>

<p>To deploy JAlgoArena - you will need to spin up Nomad and Consul clusters plus install Docker Engine</p>

1. Make sure Docker is available on your machines
1. Install Consul and Nomad clusters
   * use [step0.sh](https://github.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena-Nomad/blob/master/step0.sh) to run locally on your laptop - it's not recommended for production use case
   * [Install Consul Cluster](https://www.consul.io/intro/getting-started/join.html)
   * [Install Nomad Cluster](https://www.nomadproject.io/intro/getting-started/cluster.html)
1. Once you have Nomad and Consul up and running, you may start running JAlgoArena external services:
   * Clone JAlgoArena-Nomad locally `git clone https://github.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena-Nomad.git`
   * go to cloned repo, and run [./step1.sh](https://github.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena-Nomad/blob/master/step1.sh) - this will run all necessary tools
     * make sure that traefik, kafka, zookeeper, cockrouch are seen healthy in your Consul Web UI
1. Run JAlgoArena microservices:
   * go to cloned repo, and run [./step2.sh](https://github.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena-Nomad/blob/master/step2.sh) - this will run all microservices
   * after verifying all Nomad jobs are running and healthy within Consul - open JAlgoArena Web UI
     * if you are on machine where it's hosted - http://localhost:3000

Ok, let's run empty code - and go to submissions ...

... whoops! Something went wrong - let's check what ...

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena/master/design/ui/compile_error.png)

Yep right 😊 Let's check again source code we have submitted ...

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalgoarena/JAlgoArena/master/design/ui/source_code.png)

Seems obvious now 😊 As we run empty method which expected to return some value ... you see now. Ok, let's check ranking!

Seems Kraków is leading competition 😊

That's it for now 🐣!
