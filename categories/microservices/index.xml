      <description>Submissions flow Submissions flow within JAlgoArena was already re-designed few times, mostly I was focusing on improvements around chosen technology.
The major upgrade happen when submission flow has changed from synchronous highly coupled design to asynchronous based on apache kafka with decoupled components.
Now I would like to stop and rethink all of that, in technology agnostic way. The approach I want to choose is strictly based on requirements, then modeling messages - the only way to communicate in a new submissions world.</description>
